# C++ Class

## File path

You should get something similar to this:

```
Enter the path to create this class in (Use forward slashes (/ this one)):
```

Over here you have enter the folder to create the class files in.
Here is an example :smiley: : C:/dev/*Your Project* (This will create a folder if you don't have on already)

After you will get this:

```
Enter the class name (No spaces):
```

Over here you have to enter the name of the class (It **CANNOT** contain spaces).
Here is an example :smiley: : MyClass

And done :satisfied:!

The header file looks like this:

```
class YourClass
{

};
```

And the C++ file looks like this:

```
#include "YourClass.h"
```
