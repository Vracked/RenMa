# .NET Documentation

**NOTE**: .NET C# and VB have the same generation process. VB just has an option to create an empty project. This will focus on C# :smiley:.

You should see something similar to this:

```
Select any one of these:
1. Console app
2. Class library
3. WinForms
4. WPF
```

You can select the one you would like.

After that you will get something like this:

```
Enter the folder to create this in:
```

Here you have to enter the file path/folder to create the project.
It will create a new folder with the folder name you entered if it does'nt already exist.
Here is an example :smiley: : C:/dev/*Your folder*

You will then see this

```
Enter the name of the project:
```

Here you have to enter the name of the project.
Here is an example :smiley: : VeryCoolProject

This open a new window which should close after everything is done.

And we are done :smiley:
